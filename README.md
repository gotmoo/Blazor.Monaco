## Introduction

The `Blazor.Monaco` package provides a [Blazor](https://blazor.net) component which adds the [Monaco Editor](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) to your Blazor pages. This is the same engine that powers [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode). The package handles adding all the required components to your site and the interaction between your C# and JavaScript.
